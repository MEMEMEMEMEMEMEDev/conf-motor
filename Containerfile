# conf-motor — a python service, built and run on the same mirrored
# image.
#
# WHY THE FROM IS A PLACEHOLDER. `aegis app new` resolves it against the
# INTERNAL registry when it instantiates, and writes the reference
# pinned by digest. An image pulled off the internet by tag is a mutable
# pointer inside the pipeline that afterwards signs the result, which is
# the hole mirror-images exists to close. And the digest cannot be
# computed here: the mirror rebuilds the manifest as it copies, so
# upstream's digest is not the one that pulls.
#
# ONE STAGE AND NOT TWO, unlike the node and java templates. A second
# stage buys nothing while there is nothing to leave behind: with no
# dependencies there is no compiler and no build cache to strip. The day
# you install wheels that need a toolchain (anything with C behind it),
# split it: build in this image, then COPY the site-packages into a
# fresh one. What you must not do is add a compiler to the runtime.

# PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE: the tenant pod's root filesystem is READ
# ONLY, so python cannot write the __pycache__ it tries to create beside
# every module on first import. It fails silently and re-parses the
# source on every start — a slow container and no error anywhere. Say
# no explicitly instead.
# PYTHONUNBUFFERED: without it stdout is block-buffered when it is not a
# terminal, so the pod's log arrives in 4KB lumps, minutes late, and
# empty exactly when you are watching a crash.

# COMMENTED ON PURPOSE, and not forgotten: with an empty requirements
# this line is a no-op that still costs an egress the build does not
# have. Tenant builds run inside the cluster, where reaching PyPI is a
# decision somebody has to make (an index mirror, or an egress rule) —
# not something a template should assume. Uncomment it the day you have
# dependencies AND that decision:
#   RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --require-hashes -r requirements.txt
# `--require-hashes` is the pip equivalent of `npm ci`: it installs the
# exact artifacts that were reviewed, not whatever resolves today.
