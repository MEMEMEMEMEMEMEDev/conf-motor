          # there is no panel and no alert that reads it. So
          # `scan_skipped:true` travelled, got filed away, and the
          # build ended GREEN with an image that was never scanned
          # running in production. Found on 2026-08-22 while going
          # over why the observability sweep had not caught it: it did
          # not catch it because the instrument did not exist.
          #
          # The bootstrap tolerance (above, the scan and sign stages)
          # is correct and it stays: during phases 50-70 there is no
          # trivy-server and no cosign key, and breaking the build
          # there would mean blocking the startup. What cannot stay is
          # that tolerance being INVISIBLE once the platform is on its
          # feet. A log nobody reads is not a signal.
          #
          # The two sides are not symmetric, and that is why the alert
          # keeps them apart: with no signature Kyverno REJECTS the
          # admission and the deploy fails loudly; with no scan
          # nothing happens — the image goes in, runs, and the only
          # difference from a healthy one is that nobody looked at
          # this one.
          #
          # Only when there really was a build: with SKIP_BUILD the
          # pipeline produced no artifact, and pushing 0 would say
